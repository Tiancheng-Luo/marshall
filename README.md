Marshall
========

This repository contains exact real arithmetic implementations:

* `ocaml` contains an implementation of the Marshall programming language, which is a
  programming language for exact real arithmetic based on ideas from [Abstract Stone
  Duality (ASD)](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/) and the construction of the [Dedekind
  reals in ASD](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/analysis#dedras). See the enclosed
  `README.md` directory for details.

* `haskell` contains a Haskell implementation of real numbers which follows some of the
  ideas of Marshall. It is designed as a Haskell library rather than a standalone
  programming language.
